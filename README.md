## Description

We have created a back-end Team Generator that provides questions to user to answer and plugs in information into a designed html file for a website. The user is first prompted to enter information about the Manager position such as name, id, and number. Then it will ask the user to fill in other positions with choices of engineer, intern, or no other positions. Once no other positions is chosen, the html file will be created and can be opened through live server to see on website.
